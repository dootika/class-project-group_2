# Project Repository

Hello Reader!!!
Welcome to our project repository, this is the folder where we house all of our code.
Here is a quick runthrough of all the files present in this folder.

1. `Data Scrapping and Cleaning`
   This folder contains various files that house the code that we used to clean and scrape the data that we used in our analysis for the project. The files are named according to their function. This folder also houses a rudimentary data-set that we scraped initially, but that can be ignored.
2. `Project Report`
   This folder has our Project Report Files, the <code>ProjectReport.qmd</code> file is the main one. You can render this to get our main Project report.
3. `R Shiny App`
   This folder contains our R Shiny App. The name of the app file is <code>app.r</code>
4. `Finaldata Files`
   These are the files that store our final data. This data is cleaned, arranged and can be studied in the raw form for any further analysis that the reader wants to explore.

Thanks a lot for reading this.

### Have fun with the App!!!
